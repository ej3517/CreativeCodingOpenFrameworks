## Generating Project Files

These examples do _not_ come with the project files pre-generated. You will need to use the [OF ProjectGenerator](http://openframeworks.cc/learning/01_basics/create_a_new_project) to create them for each example (you should only need to do this once).

To (re)generate project files for an _existing_ project:

- click the "Import" button in the ProjectGenerator
- navigate the to base folder for the project ie. "Bounce"
- click the "Update" button

If everything went OK, you should now be able to open the generated project and build/run the example.
